Arduino RC Tank Game
http://tiny.cc/duinotanks <== code and these notes


::What we'll cover here...(so you know if you want to stay)::


Making large(ish) arduino projects manageable
==> alternate ides
==> existing IDE use (making things easier)
==> OO with arduino

Little bit about game flow/how I solved it

CODE! Making the tanks *go*.  (basic motor control)
CODE! Controlling the tank with the nrf24L01+ radios
CODE! Encoding values & transmitting/receiving Infrared signals
CODE! Xfer data arduino to arduino w/EasyTransfer softserial library
CODE! Displaying data out to the user via I2C lcd display

Q&A

NOT A LOT OF:
hardware discussion (unless it directly relates to the code)
how much did it cost (because my wife might find out)







Let's get started!







[video]








Aaron Backer
qa automation engineer for Kount













Original goals:

Tanks should identify who shot them and with what
Selectable weapons do differing amounts of damage
Multiple tank "shields"
Extendable to many tanks (more than just 2)



Eventually...(scope creep!)

tanks communicate back to host computer
  host computer displays battle stats
tanks with different abilities
  change shield values, recharge rates, speed
load tank configs by SD card
rumble feedback to joystick
sound & light effects
degrading performance as tank is hit
LASERS!  (because everything's cooler with lasers...)














Sooo...if I wanted to do this ~ coding aside, how much would it cost?
<shhh!!>

2x robot chassis:         $24       2x l298 motor controllers   $7
4x 2.4ghz radio           $8
2x arduino uno clones     $14
2x arduino nano clones    $7
2x arduino pro mini       $5
2x 16x2 LCD               $5
2x I2C lcd backpack       $2
8x IR sensors             $7
2x IR LED                 $2
2x cheap headlamps        $5
2x 6x AA battery box      $7
2x thrift store joystick  $10
standoffs                 $8
2x batteries (or cases)   $7 - $$$$$
I used my mini 12v drill batteries as they were lightweight,
suited for high discharge, and rechargeable.  And I already had them.

Otherwise, I probably would have just gone with another two 6x 
(or 8x) AA cases...


GRAND TOTAL.....          $111  (yikes!)

(note: didn't cost me that much, as I had many of the materials...)















Lots of code...and the hardest bits were code to *communicate*
  

tank <--> controller (2.4ghz radios)
tank1 <--> tank2 (IR beam)
user <-- tank (I2C LCD display)
tank1 <—-> tank1 (EasyTransfer serial)


Tank logic was trivial…hardware layer integration was much more challenging
were problems code...or hardware?!!
(hint: use the libraries sample apps...simple!)


beyond simple, trivial apps organization becomes more important

loop() {
  analogRead(0); //read a sensor
  digitalWrite(14,HIGH); //light an led!
  delay(1000) //wait a sec...
}
//simple, single purpose/single task programs



while Processing (arduino’s code) is based on C/C++,
some gotchas here and there where full C++ OO isn’t…quite…all there
So some things you think *should* work…just don’t. (quite)
























---Arduino OO 101 - Classes, variables, member functions

Define a header for enums, custom types if passed to functions!

note: all member functions (public or private) _must_ be in the header

define your member variables in here too

good to go with a convention: _myVariable is a local-to-the-class var

(with a nice color coding IDE not such a big deal...see below)











---More Oddities
strange compiler/linker behavior with parameterized constructors containing custom objects
[demo error -- Tank::Tank]
solution: add weird line to init objects on constructor line
-OR-
add a parameterless constructor (even if you don't use it)

using enums ~ gotta put them in their own .h file to avoid compile errors when passed as params

Processing passes by value...so for objects init'ed in main, pointers are your friends

Odd behavior when accessing an object which is a property of an object

mytank.getShield().regen() <-- does not work, but
mytank.regenShield() <-- DOES work

(where regenShield just calls _shield.regen() within the tank object)












---Handy things to know/do

Syntax highlighting for larger projects is *very* nice...

If on windows, take a look at MS Visual Studio 2013 + VisualMicro!
[demo]

On mac, Sublime text with the arduino plugin works well

(where-to-get-em @ end of notes)



particularly for this project -- IMPORTANT!

remove existing lcd,IR, and EasyTransfer libraries from arduino dir!
(else weird compile errors, no good worky)

windows: C:\Program Files\Arduino\libraries
mac: /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries

Remove these dirs: LiquidCrystal, RobotIRremote, Robot_Control, and Robot_Motor

all contain conflicts with the IR & EasyTransfer libs you'll install












---MAKING THINGS MOVE
[motor control demo]


*** flip values for forward/reverse if they're not working
*** feedback loop (optical encoders) would have made steering easier, 
    code more complex








---CONTROLLING STUFF 
[RF24Network demo]


A NOTE ON NODES...
node 00 is root -- there is a TREE STRUCTURE!!

nodes 01 - 05 are children

node 012 is the first child of node 02
node 0312 is the third child of node 012

a node, coming up, will need to find it's parent
so address appropriately!

(eg: someone will need to have node 00 as it's parent)

Side effect of the network library being used for mesh networks










---SHOOTING STUFF
[IR demo]

a sunlight-flooded room will *way* wonk up being able to 
send/receive reliably. (killed a solid hour troubleshooting that)

multiple receivers don't work with default library, use forked library 
(URL is @ end of notes)

ALSO...one UNO didn't have enough OOMPH to manage checking 4 IR receivers 
AND do network communication AND send IR.  So I added a second arduino (pro mini)
to each arduino uno that ONLY does the IR checking.



Sending a single value is (relatively) easy...

I wanted to send multiple bits of data...solution: 
4 4bit numbers (0-15) bitmashed together into one long (32 bit) number!











---TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES
[EasyTransfer demo]


very easy...two arbitrary digital ports between 2 arduinos















---Highlights, controller

****LCD


the super-cheap $1 I2C to LCD adapters I bought on ebay needed this particular advice:
http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=157817.0
which references this page:
http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/LCD-Blue-I2C


use i2c scan app to discover lcd's i2c address (not always what is advertised)
http://gammon.com.au/i2c 



constant updating will cause flicker
easy way to fix that, only update every 100 milliseconds:

if (millis() % 100 == 0) {
	lcd.setCursor(0,0);
	lcd.print("msg line 1 goz here");
  lcd.setCursor(0,1);
  lcd.print("msg line 2 goz here");
}











--MISC:
POWER!  with one usb plugged in and 2 arduinos connected, one will sponge off another, not enough power to run everything (example: ir ports not working...)




---LIBRARIES USED---

**IRremote
infrared transmitter/receiver library for arduino
http://www.righto.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html

use _this_ fork if you're going to do multiple IR receivers...it's the only one I found
to work reliably: https://github.com/skbrii/IRremote



**RF24Network
home: http://maniacbug.github.io/RF24Network/
src: https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24Network
using inexpensive nRF24L01(+) radios easily (cheap alternative to zigbee)
cool tip: a tcp/ip stack (sorta) for these things is available: http://embeddedcoolness.com/home/



**EasyTransfer -- Arduino to Arduino communication
home: http://www.billporter.info/2011/05/30/easytransfer-arduino-library/
src: https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-EasyTransfer
I2C, software serial, virtualwire versions
If using an I2C lcd, *that* arduino *has* to be the master...and there are oddities for
who can send/receive between master and slave.  (so I used software serial)



**I2C Lcd
somewhat specific to the i2c chipset
the super-cheap $1 I2C to LCD adapters I bought on ebay needed this particular advice:

--PARTS--
arduino uno clones:
--note about USB chipsets..
for windows, linux, and mac, you'll need to find and install the CH340G USB Driver for these to work.
easiest way...go here:
https://github.com/bgaultier/laboite-webapp
download the archive as a .zip
use ch341ser_mac.zip for mac, CH341SER.EXE for windows
