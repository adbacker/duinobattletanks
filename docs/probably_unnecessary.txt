Game flow, controller:
* read joystick, trigger
* send controller update to tank
* check for messages from tank (I wuz hit!)
* update lcd


Tank:
* check for network messages (controller updates)
* if firing, FIRE!
* update motor controller
* IRduino checks if we were hit (EasyTransfer -> softserial)
* if hit, send msg to controller











--super quick refresher on pointer notation, dereferencing, etc (SKIP ME!)

int a;  //a contains an integer value..
int* b; //b contains a _pointer_ (an address in memory) to an integer type

b = &a;  // &a says "give me the pointer to this variable"
         // not the var itself, but it's address in memory
         // so now b contains a's "address"
         // this is called "dereferencing a variable"  
         // dereference == 'get me the damn address of'

int c = *b; // *b means "show me what the pointer b is pointing _at_"
            //so c now contains whatever b was pointing at...
